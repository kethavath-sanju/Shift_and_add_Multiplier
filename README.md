# Shift_and_add_Multiplier
This project implements a Shift and Add Multiplier, a classic sequential multiplication algorithm used in digital systems. It multiplies two binary numbers by performing a series of shifts and additions, mimicking how multiplication is done manually in binary form.

# How it works
1.Check each bit of the multiplier (starting from LSB).
2.If the current bit is 1, add the multiplicand to the partial product.
3.Shift the multiplicand left by one bit each cycle.
4.Continue until all bits of the multiplier are processed.

# Tools Used
Cadence Xcelium/Incisive, LEC, IMC(Code coverage), Genus(Synthesize).
